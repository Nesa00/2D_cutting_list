# 2D cutting list
2D cutting list optimization is a mathematical problem that involves cutting large sheets of material, such as metal or wood, into smaller pieces with minimal waste. This is typically done in manufacturing and construction industries where raw materials are expensive and need to be used efficiently. The problem involves determining the optimal cutting layout for a given set of items, taking into account their sizes and shapes, and the dimensions of the material sheets.

The process of cutting optimization involves finding the best layout for cutting shapes from large sheets, such that the total area of wasted material is minimized. This requires an understanding of the available sheet sizes and the sizes of the items to be cut, as well as algorithms that can generate optimal cutting layouts.

There are various software tools and libraries available that can perform 2D cutting list optimization, which can help businesses save time and money by reducing material waste and improving efficiency in their production processes.
